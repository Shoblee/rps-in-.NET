# Rock, Paper, Scissors thingy
I originally started making this because my teacher told me to, but then I ended up kind of interested so I just worked on it whenever I was bored.\
Basically it is just a console application made in .NET Core with C#.

Planning on testing/getting this working on unix systems eventually, going to test and get it working in arch linux terminals whenever I am home.
